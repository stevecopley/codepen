# Libraries Required

Two libraries are used for this:
- [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)
- [Jotted](https://ghinda.net/jotted/)

**CodeMirror** is used out of the box - just need to download the [latest 5.x distribution](https://codemirror.net/codemirror.zip) and copy it into this lib folder

**Jotted** is no longer updated it seems, so the last minimised CSS and JS files are used here, but some CSS and JS functions are then overwritten via the accompanying *-custom files
